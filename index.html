    <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">In Pakistan, gender discrimination in education occurs among the poorest households.Only 18% of Pakistani women have received 10 years or more of schooling.Among other criticisms the Pakistani education system faces is the gender disparity in enrollment levels. However, in recent years some progress has been made in trying to fix this problem. In 1990–91, the female to male ratio (F/M ratio) of enrollment was 0.47 for primary level of education. It reached to 0.74 in 1999–2000, showing the F/M ratio has improved by 57.44% within the decade.</p>
